Some people like their milk sweetened and flavored. Be sure to use the best ingredients for the best results. We've added a bit of honey or sugar to our nut milks, also vanilla and nutmeg or cinnamon. Since favors are a matter of taste, we recommend that you try some out and remember that it is easier to add flavor that take it out, so try a little at first, seasoning to taste.
