Making nut milk at home is easy.  It is accomplished by filling a cloth or nylon bag with ground nut solids and water. A typical nut milk bag is quart size and is specifically designed to hold tight to the mouth of a container as you spoon in the mixture. While we are focusing on nut milk here, keep in mind that you can filter other things with this bag too, such as filtered juices or coffee. An organic nut milk bag is particularly good for this because leaching fluids through a mesh will draw out any chemicals used in making the bag. So an_organic_ bag is critical unless you are okay with synthetic chemicals in your food.
